JDupes Helper
=========================

Helper for iteratively processing JDupes output files

[JDupes](https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes) is a great tool for detecting duplicate files.

My itch, was having a NAS with 10's of 1000's of photos/videos with way too many duplicates.
JDupes gave me output of text files listing groups of duplicate files, each group separated by a new line.

I needed to parse these groups and drill down on these groups and iteratively build
the lists of files I wanted to delete.
