# JDupes Helper
=========================

Helper for iteratively processing JDupes output files

[JDupes](https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes) is a very useful tool for detecting duplicate files. 
JDupes produces text output listing groups of duplicate files, each group separated by a new line.

 jdupes -r -X size-:10k /volume1/Photos/ > volume1_photos

If you have 1000's of duplicate files, deciding which files to delete can also be a big problem.
JDupes Helper facilitates iterating over the list of duplicate files gradually building up 
a list of files to delete based on incrementally selecting files based on simple rules:

eg
```bash
java -jar jdupes-helper-1.0.jar \
"[\
        'inFile':'volume1_photos',\
        'pattern':'/volume1/Photos/Photos.org/',\
        'mode':'preserve',\
        'patternMode': 'startsWith',\
        'deleteFile':'to_delete',\
        'appendDeleteFile':'true',\
        'verbose':'false'\
``]"
```
inFile: Name of file generated by jdupes





### Output

```bash
'preserve' files matched by '/volume1/Photos/Photos.org/' using 'startsWith' in file 'volume1_photos'
30505 groups processed, 7089 candidates for deletion, 23743 remaining groups (51945 remaining files)
/Users/me/jdupes-play/to_delete
/Users/me/jdupes-play/dupes.20190210.230741
```

## Build instructions

gradle 4.x required
'gradle'
to build

## TODO

Add more processors:
1. "del pattern1 iff dupe in pattern2"
2. if pattern matches all in group, just leave one


## How it works
Literal groovy map passed as a param, passed straight
to the map ctor of a Options classâ‰
