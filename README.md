JDupes Helper
=========================

Helper for iteratively processing JDupes output files

[JDupes](https://github.com/jbruchon/jdupes) is a great tool for detecting duplicate files. JDupes produces text output listing groups of duplicate files, each group separated by a new line.

My problem, was having a NAS with 10's of 1000's of photos/videos with way too many duplicates.
I needed to parse these groups and drill down on these groups and iteratively build a list of files I wanted to delete.
